  VHDL code for the TE0890 Spartan7 Mini Board
  ============================================

The Trenz Electronics TE0890 is a small, low-cost Spartan7 FPGA module
(also known as the Black Mesa Labs S7-Mini FPGA module).

The purpose of this repository is to develop test designs for
the TE0890 board. These designs will explore the functionality of
the board and hopefully serve as building blocks for larger applications.
